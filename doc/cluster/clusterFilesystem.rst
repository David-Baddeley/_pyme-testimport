PYME Cluster File System
************************

PYME includes support for a very simple clustered "file system", designed to support real time streaming and analysis of
 localization data. The main design goals of this file system are:

- high *write* performance to allow streaming from sCMOS cameras
- good read performance for *node local* data access during analysis
- simple to setup and access

For the sake of simplicity and performance, the "filesystem" does not permit random access within files (**reads and writes
are atomic on the whole file level**) and does not perform the type of expensive cluster-wide locking operations that
would be expected in a general purpose distributed filesystem. This lack of locking is facilitated by the atomic file
reads and writes. With some minor exceptions [#aggregate]_, write operations
are strictly *write once* and write in entirety with **no** modification or deletion.

.. warning::

    The lack of cluster-wide locking means that there is the potential for a race condition when performing file creation
    from multiple processes / computers (creation fails if the file already exists, but the existence test relies on a
    locally cached version of the cluster directory tree, with an expiration time of 2-3s).

    **The onus is on the client programmer to ensure that it is *well behaved* and that writes to the same filename do not
    occur from multiple processes simultaneously.**

Implementation
==============

The underlying filesystem protocol is based on HTTP, allowing existing HTTP protocol libraries to be used and clients to
easily be written in a variety of different languages. At it's most basic level, we simply run an HTTP server on each
machine with storage and the

.. [#aggregate] For .hdf and .txt files, the file system also supports an atomic **append** operation through special
    `_aggregate` urls. Appends made using the `_aggregate` system are not guaranteed to be processed in order, so the
    inclusion of an index key in the records to permit re-ordering in postprocessing is recommended if order is important.
