Simulator
*********

The simulator is a PYMEAcquire configuration without any real hardware. It simulates
a CCD camera which displays fake single molecule events generated from a given structure.
It also simulates a number of other hardware components such as piezo translators and is
intended as a testing/training platform for the acquisition of real data. It also allows
different dye properties and behaviours to be invetigated. The simulator is launched by
starting PYMEAcquire without specifying a startup file.
