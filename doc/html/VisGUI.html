<h3>System Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#system-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>VisGUI will run on relatively low spec machines (I&#8217;ve had it running on an old single core 1.6GHz laptop with 1GB of RAM), but for an enjoyable user experience I&#8217;d recommend at least the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>~2GHz Core 2 Duo</li>
<li>2 GB Ram</li>
<li>Hardware OpenGL support</li>
<li>WinXP - I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;d run on 2K fine, not so sure about Vista or Win7</li>
<li>Wheel mouse - a wheel mouse is required for zooming in the interactive display</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re wanting to get peak performance out of it, the factors limiting performance are likely to be memory bandwidth, graphics card performance, and the CPU, in that order.</p>

<h2>Importing Data<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To import data, simply use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">File-&gt;Open</span></tt> menu command, launch VisGUI from the command line with the filename as an argument, or right click on a data file in windows explorer and select <strong>Open With</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>you&#8217;ll need to tell windows where to find VisGUI the first time you do this.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Three data formats are currently supported - our custom <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.h5r</span></tt> format, tab delimited text, and matlab <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.mat</span></tt> files. In each case, the data should take the form of a table of values where each row corresponds to a detected single molecule event, and each column corresponds to one of the fitted parameters such as, for example, x position, y position, or amplitude. All position values are assumed to be in nm. The table must contain the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> positions of the localised single molecule events, and may contain any other pertinant parameters. It is suggested that at least folowing parameters should also be included: the time/frame number at which the event was detected, the event amplitude, event width, and the estimated localisation error.</p>
<p>Once loaded the columns are accessed by semi-descriptive names, with the names <strong>x, y, t, A, sig, error_x</strong> being recognised by the program as the previously introduced parameters.
:note: the program will not work if either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> is undefined</p>
<div class="section" id="h5r-format">
<h3>.h5r format<a class="headerlink" href="#h5r-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Loading .h5r formatted files is pretty much a no-brainer. All parameters such as column names are read out of the file for you, as well as acquisition meta-data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tab-formatted-text">
<h3>Tab formatted text<a class="headerlink" href="#tab-formatted-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When importing tab formatted text files, you have to define the column names yourself, using the import dialog. You can also specify the column names within the text file to speed up this process by adding a python style comment (signified by a leading #) to the first line of the file containing a list of tab seperated column names. The dialog will still be shown for confirmation, but the correct column names should already be entered.</p>

<div class="section" id="matlab-mat-files">
<h3>Matlab .mat files<a class="headerlink" href="#matlab-mat-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If reading .mat files, VisGUI expects the data to be in a single array. The import dialog is a little more primitive in this case, but the same principle applies - each column needs to be given a name, and the names <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> must be defined. The names are specified by typing a comma separated list of names into the supplied box. Each of the names must be enclosed in double quotes, and there must be exactly the same number of names as there are columns.</p>

<div class="section" id="exploring-the-data">
<h2>Exploring the data<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-the-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having sucessfully loaded a dataset, you should see something resembling the image shown below. If you don&#8217;t see anything, don&#8217;t panic, the most common reason is that the filter is throwing all your data points away - see <em class="xref">The Filter</em>.</p>
<img alt="_images/vis_gui_data_loaded.png" src="_images/vis_gui_data_loaded.png" />
<p>Within the viewer, the data follows a pipeline as illustrated below. The important components are described in detail in the following sections.</p>
<object data="_images/vis_pipeline.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><embed src="_images/vis_pipeline.svg" type="image/svg+xml" /></object>
<div class="section" id="the-filter">
<h3>The Filter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-filter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The filter allows a valid range for each parameter to be specified, thus restricting the analysis to a subset of the point values. This enables eroneous events where, for example, the fit did not converge or the fit picked up a noise spike rather than a true fluorophore to be discarded.</p>
<img alt="_images/filter_panel.png" src="_images/filter_panel.png" />
<p>The filter is controlled using the the filter pane of the sidebar(which can be expanded by clicking the icon in the right corner). Right clicking on the list gives you the option to add, and if a parameter is currently selected, edit or delete a parameter in the filterfootnote{on windows, you sometimes need to click the right mouse button 2-3 times before the menu pops up.}. Double clicking on a filter also allows the filter to be edited. Editing filters brings up a dialog as shown below. A histogram of the selected variable is displayed and the current bounds indicated by red vertical lines. These lines can be dragged with the mouse to change the filter. The filter editor (and all other histogram editors) also understand the following keys if they have focus:</p>
<img alt="_images/filter_edit.png" src="_images/filter_edit.png" />
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="4%" />
<col width="96%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><em>m</em></td>
<td>sets the bounds to the minumum and maximum values of the variable</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>p</em></td>
<td>sets the bounds to the 1st and 99th percentiles</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><em>l</em></td>
<td>toggles log scaling on y-axis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The filter will typically come with default bounds for <em>A</em> (the point amplitude), <em>sig</em> (the std deviation of the fitted Gaussian), and <em>error_x</em> (the estimated error in the x position). The default values are for our setup and imaging at ~ 488 nm excitation, and are quite likely to need changing. Notably <em>A</em> will need changing if you&#8217;re intensity is calibrated differently, and <em>sig</em> will need changing when working at different wavelengths.</p>
<p>The filter is also used to restrict the data to a smaller spatial ROI, by adding filters on the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> variables. Rather than manually creating and setting these filters, a selection can be made by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button in the view tab (a yellow selection rectangle should be shown), and then clicking on <strong>Clip to Selection</strong> in the filter pane. The ROI can then be cleared by clicking the same button.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mapping-colour">
<h3>Mapping &amp; Colour<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-colour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default the mapping component of the pipeline simply passes the variables from the filte without change. One can however add mappings which can either define new variables or redefine existing variables. Drift correction, for example, is accomplished as remapping the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> variables as a function of their original values and time, eg: <img class="math" src="_images/math/35597429ec7d38652f80633f3c47a848e7c37813.png" alt="x = x' +f(t)"/>. In principle other transformations, for instance rotation, are possible. There is no direct GUI control over the mapping component, but it is manipulated by the drift correction controls (see :ref:Drift Correction).</p>
<p>Following the mapping component there is a colour selection component. This is only important when processing ratiometric multi-colour images (see Multi-Colour), and is effectively transparent at all other times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interactive-display">
<h3>Interactive Display<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The interactive display is designed to provide a quick and easy method of looking the data. There are 6 different display modes, which can be selected from the <strong>View</strong> menu. The basic operation of display window is common to all: The display can be zoomed in and out using the mouse wheel, and panning is accomplished by sooming out, and back in in a different place. Choosing the <strong>Fit</strong> item from the <strong>View</strong> menu will reset the display such that the whole image fits within the display window. A scale bar and colour look up table are displayed at the right of the image. The <strong>Display</strong> panel in the left sidebar allows the colormap and scaling to be changed (note that the histogram display works the same as those in the filter).</p>
<img alt="_images/disp_panel.png" src="_images/disp_panel.png" />
<p>In addition to the <strong>Display</strong> panel, each mode may display a panel with mode-specific settings such as the <strong>Points</strong> panel. A more detailed description of the various modes is given in the following sections:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Points Mode</strong></dt>
<dd>The default visualisation mode is the points mode, in which each localisation event is   displayed as a point. The colour of each point can be set to any of the event variables.</dd>
<dt><strong>Triangles Mode</strong></dt>
<dd>In this mode the point positions are triangulated and the triangles displayed with an intensity inversely proportional to their area. See also Image Generation.</dd>
<dt><strong>Quad-Tree</strong></dt>
<dd>A quad tree is generated from the event data and each leaf is coloured with an intensity which is proportional to the number of points it contains, and inversely proportional to it&#8217;s size. The leaf capacity (ie the size at which a leaf will be subdivided) can be adjusted. For more info see paper.</dd>
<dt><strong>Voronoi Diagram</strong></dt>
<dd>Similar to triangulation but using the voronoi diagram of the points rather than the triangularisation. Much slower - would suggest only applying to a subset of the image data.</dd>
<dt><strong>Interpolated Triangles</strong></dt>
<dd>As for the triangle mode, the points are triangulated. The colour, however, is derived by interpolating vertex colours derived from one of the variables. Is most suited to visualising parameters which are likely to be correlated for neighbouring events, such as chromatic shift measurements.</dd>
<dt><strong>Blobs</strong></dt>
<dd>This mode attempts to segment the image into connected areas based on neighbour distances, and allows various measurements to be performed on these segmented objects. Might not work under windows.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drift-correction">
<h2>Drift Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#drift-correction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Automatic drift correction can be performed based on the premise that changed in the image due to drift will be time correlated, whereas the actual structure shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>Our drift correction procedure assumes that the drift can be approximated with a simple mathematical function, and estimates the drift by maximising an entropy measure whilst varying the parameters of this function. Before commencing drift correction, it is useful to set up the interactive display with the following settings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Point mode</li>
<li>Point colouring using the <em>t</em> (time) variable</li>
<li>A colour map such as <strong>gist_rainbow</strong> which displays all points with approximately the same brightness, and allows small variations in values to be seen</li>
<li>The colour limits set such that the colour map covers the entire range of <em>t</em>-values</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/drift_colour_coded.png" src="_images/drift_colour_coded.png" />
<p>With these settings it should be possible to see any drift as colour banding or streaking across objects. If the data contains a large number of events, it might also be wise to select a ROI (see Filter section) to accelerate the fitting process. If selecting a ROI, try to select a region with well defined structures, for which the drift is clearly visible in the coloured - points representation. After the drift has been estimated, the ROI can be cleared and the correction applied to the whole image.</p>
<p>Drift correction is controlled using the <strong>Drift Correction</strong> pane in the sidebar. The two text fields allow mathematical expressions to be entered for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> drifts. These can be pretty arbitrary expressions, and are in python syntax. This has a few practical consequences which you need to know about; if you want to evaluate, for example, <img class="math" src="_images/math/8f9af910fe749481919573c0dd2b132118f19d19.png" alt="x^y"/>, you would write <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x**y</span></tt>, square brackets denote a list, and you&#8217;ve also got to be a bit careful not to use language keywords as variables.</p>
<p>The drift expressions automatically recognise variable names from the loaded data, as well as several mathematical functions and constants <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3">[2]</a>. Any remaining names are assigned as parameters to be fitted, and will appear in the parameters box. It is always a good idea to check that the desired parameters appear in the parameters box, and that nothing else does. Two drift expression presets, namely linear and piecewise linear are available from the presets drop down.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id3">[2]</a></td><td>a list of functions/constants can be obtained by entering <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">PYME.Analysis.DriftCorrection</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">intelliFit;</span> <span class="pre">dir(intelliFit)</span></tt> in the console window. Note that there&#8217;s quite a few functions defined which are likely to be irrelevant for the fitting.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Once a pair of drift expressions has been chosen, the parameters can be edited by left clicking on their value. This can be used to set start values for the fit(although this is not typically required for the simpler - linear, piecewise linear - fits), or to experiment manually as to the effect of altering the parameters on the image. Clicking <strong>Fit</strong> fits the parameters by maximisation of the previously discussed entropy measure.</p>
<p>To actually apply the correction, with either estimated or manually entered parameters you need to click on the <strong>Apply</strong> button. Clicking on the <strong>Revert</strong> button removes the correction. The <strong>Plot</strong> button displays a plot of the fitted drift.</p>
<img alt="_images/drift_plot.png" src="_images/drift_plot.png" />
<p>We typically find that a simple linear correction is enough to reduce the drift to a level where residual drift is on the order of or less than the localisation precision. For cases where strongly position dependant colouring is still visible after linear correction we take two approaches - either adding polynomial terms to effectively form a Taylor-expansion for the drift, or using a piecewise linear function to model the drift. Of the two, the later generally seems the more promising. When fitting complex expressions, e.g. higher order polynomials, it is often useful to extend the fit one term at a time, using the previously fitted values as starting values for the old parameters.</p>
<div class="section" id="validation">
<h3>Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To enable some form of validation of the drift estimates, we have included a second drift estimation function, based on binning frames together in time and performing a cross-correlation between the images obtained (by calculating a histogram of the point positions within each time bin) from the different bins.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this method is that the temporal and spatial bin sizes typically need extensive tweaking for each image, and as such the method is not currently particularly robust (although there may be some room for improvement here).</p>
<p>This is accessible from the menu bar as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Extras-&gt;Estimate</span></tt> drift using cross-correlation} and displays the dialog shown below. The bin size parameter determines the 2D histogram bin size used for creating the images, the window size is the number of frames to bin, and the time step dictates the time points at which the drift is to be estimates (if this is smaller than the window size, the windows at each time step will be overlapping).</p>
<img alt="_images/correlation_drift_dialog.png" src="_images/correlation_drift_dialog.png" />
<p>After clicking on <strong>OK</strong>, the drift will be estimated and a graph such as that shown below displayed. If the drift has been estimated and a correction applied using the standard drift estimation tools, the estimated drift curves will be displayed on the graph as dotted lines. It is important to note that the drift estimate obtained in this fashion is quite dependent on the choice of binning parameters etc... - the right panel shows a curve estimated for the same data as in the left but using a smaller window size, and is dominated by noise.</p>
<img alt="_images/drift_est_corr_graph.png" src="_images/drift_est_corr_graph.png" />

<div class="section" id="image-generation">
<h2>Image Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#image-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After optimising the filter, corrected drift, and doing other sanity checks on the data, one typically wishes to generate an image. This is accomplished by choosing one of the options from the <strong>Generate Image</strong> menu. All image generation methods generate an image which matches the region currently displayed in the interactive display (View) tab. Remember that the display can be zoomed to the whole image using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">View-&gt;Fit</span></tt> menu item.</p>
<img alt="_images/generate_triangulation_dialog.png" src="_images/generate_triangulation_dialog.png" />
<p>Each method will also display a simlar dialog (but potentially with a slightly different set of options) prompting for the pixel size and any other parameters. The individual methods are described in the following:</p>
<div class="section" id="image-generation-methods">
<h3>Image Generation Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#image-generation-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Current</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Current</em> method reproduces what is currently displayed in the interactive display, at a specified pixel size. Note that only the intensity is captured and not the colour information. Whilst this is what you want in some situations, it is not universally so and a colour capture is on the TODO list.</dd>
<dt><strong>Gaussian</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Gaussian</em> method performs standard Gaussian visualisation. It defaults to using the estimated position error as the standard deviation of the rendered Gaussian, but any of the parameters can be used. Using the fitted standard deviation, <em>sig</em>, for example allows the easy generation of pseudo-diffraction limited images.</dd>
<dt><strong>Histogram</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>histogram</em> method simply produces a 2D histogram of the point position data with the specified bin size.</dd>
<dt><strong>Triangularisation</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">This performs a Delaunay triangularisation based rendering, with the option of averaging several triangulations based on slightly jittered point positions (see <em>Visualisation of Localisation Microscopy Data, Microscopy &amp; Microanalysis</em>). The variable which dictates the jitter magnitude can be selected and defaults to a measure of the distance between a point and it&#8217;s neighbours. The number of samples to average defaults to 10.</p>
<p class="last">In addition to jittering, it is also possible to smooth the triangularisation by averaging several triangularisations performed on Monte-Carlo subsets of the point positions. If you want to try this out, set the multiplier for the jitter to 0 and set the MC subsampling probability to less than 1 (~ 0.2 is probably a good start).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Quad-Tree</strong></dt>
<dd>The <strong>Quad-Tree</strong> method allows a quad tree (see <em class="xref">sec:intQT</em>,*Visualisation of Localisation Microscopy Data ...*) to be rendered at a given pixel size. The bin depth setting from the Quad tree in the interactive display is used.</dd>
<dt><strong>3D Histogram &amp; 3D Gaussian</strong></dt>
<dd>These methods are 3D versions of the histogram and Gaussian methods for data with <em>z</em> information. 3D versions of the triangularisation and Quad-Tree algorithms are in progress.</dd>

<h3>Generated Images<a class="headerlink" href="#generated-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After an image has been generated, it should pop up in a new window. All image windows are locked to the main view window in both position and zoom. Scrolling on any image window will thus result in a global zoom over all image windows. The colour scaling in the generated images can be adjusted selecting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">View-&gt;Colour</span> <span class="pre">scaling</span></tt> menu item, which displays a small pop-up window with a histogram view.</p>
<img alt="_images/generated_image.png" src="_images/generated_image.png" />

<h4>Saving images<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

The other two options allow a multi-channel image to be saved as a TIFF stack <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id5">[3]</a>  (<strong>Save Multi-channel</strong>), and allows for exporting exactly what is currently shown in the window (complete with colour maps, scaling, and zoom) as a variety of formats (<strong>Export Current View</strong>).</p>
