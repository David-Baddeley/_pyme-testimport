This package contains code related to VisGUI, the visualization program for localization point data sets. The main
components would be:
  - :py:mod:`PYME.LMVis.VisGUI` : the main GUI code used for point visualization
  - :py:mod:`PYME.LMVis.pipeline` : the underlying pipeline object which handles file opening and manipulation (this is
                                  the core non-gui component of point processing)

Also of interest are:
  - :py:mod:`PYME.LMVis.inpFilt` : The filters and mappings used to build up the pipeline
  - :py:mod:`PYME.LMVis.renderers` : The code which interfaces the individual rendering methods used to convert point
                                   data to some kind of density map.

Plugins are located in :py:mod:`PYME.LMVis.Extras`.

The VisGUI can be launched using the `VisGUI` script.
