This module contains various routines for generating simulated PSFs.

These include:

The Gibson and Lanni model for imaging through stratified media (ps_app) and models based on Fourier propagation. For the
later, (:py:mod:`PYME.Analysis.PSFGen.fourier`) generates far field paraxial / low NA PSFs, whereas
(:py:mod:`PYME.Analysis.PSFGen.fourierHNA`) uses a modified Fourier propagation scheme which better reflects a high NA
and/or vectorial imaging scenario.

Functions are available for simulating the most common PSFs types used in localization microscopy, along with PSFs having
arbitrary pupils and / or aberrations expressed as in terms of Zernike modes.

(:py:mod:`PYME.Analysis.PSFGen.fourierHNA`) also has a basic implementation of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for pupil
phase extraction.
