def binned_average(binVar, indepVar, edges):
    """
    Take the binned average of values in indepVar binned according to their corresponding entries in binVar and a given set of edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binVar : ndarray 
        array which is used, in combination with `edges`, to determine bin membership.
    indepVar : ndarray
        array of the independent variable, to be averaged within each bin. Must be the same size as binVar.
    edges : ndarray
        array of bin edges

    Returns
    -------
    bn : int ndarray
        Number of elements within each bin
    bm : float ndarray
        Mean value of indepVar within each bin
    bs : float ndarray
        Standard deviation of indepVar within each bin
