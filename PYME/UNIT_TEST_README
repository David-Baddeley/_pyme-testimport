PYME has a small number of unit tests (hopefully increasing) and uses nose for testing.

Testing is initiated by running `nosetests` from within the `PYME` tree, and tests should be run before submitting pull
requests. New tests are very welcome!

Caveats
=======

- Tests of the fit modules use randomly generated data and the (occasional) random failure is to be expected. As long as
  fit tests don't fail consistently there shouldn't be any cause for concern.
- We don't currently test fit precision in any rigourous manner, just doing enough to ensure that we don't completely
  break things with new code.
- The test coverage is currently very poor. Passing all the tests does not ensure that you haven't broken anything and
  shouldn't be used as a substitute for a careful consideration of possible side effects.
