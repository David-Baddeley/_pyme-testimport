"""Implementation of the FrameWrangler class (previously PreviewAcquisator)
which manages the flow of information from a camera into the rest of the program,
letting dependant parts of the program know when new data arrives via signals.

As hardware control in PYMEAcquire is largely driven by and synchronized with 
camera frames, this also encompasses the 'heart' or core of the program which 
everything else responds to."""
