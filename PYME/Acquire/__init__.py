This package contains all the functionality of the `PYMEAcquire` acquisition program.

The core components are:

- :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.PYMEAcquire` : the GUI entry point
- :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.acquiremainframe` : the GUI code for the main window

- :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.microscope` : a handler / collection point for all the hardware and microscope state
- :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.frameWrangler` : controls the flow of data from the camera(s)

Most of the additional modules serve a supporting role. Of special note are the spoolers (:py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.HDFSpooler`,
:py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.QueueSpooler`, and :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.HTTPSpooler`) which are the backends for spooling data acquisition.

Drivers for different pieces of experimental hardware are found in :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.Hardware`



`PYMEAcquire` can be launched by running the `PYMEAcquire` script, specifying an initialization file to be used. For more
info see :py:mod:`PYME.Acquire.PYMEAcquire`.
